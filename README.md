## Project Description â€“Image classification using CNNs in Keras

Data Description:
You  are provided  with a  trainingset  and  a  test  set  of images  of plant  seedlings  at  various  stages of  grown. Each  image  has  a filename 
that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifiercapable of determining a plant's 
species from a photo.

Dataset:The project is from a dataset from Kaggle.

Link to the Kaggle project site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data

Note: For project purposes, download only train images folder from Kaggle.(See note at the end of problem statement.)
The dataset has to be downloaded from the above Kagglewebsite.Context:Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?The ability to do so effectively 
can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with 
University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages

Results:
Test loss: 0.5420226454734802

Test accuracy: 0.8103932738304138
